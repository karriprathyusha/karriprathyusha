# Hi there, I'm **Karri Prathyusha** 👋

I'm a B.Com Computers student at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College with foundational knowledge in accounting and a growing interest in web development. I enjoy building simple, functional web templates and learning through hands-on projects.

My goal is to create clean, responsive web designs while building a strong foundation in frontend technologies. I'm particularly interested in exploring how commerce, accounting, and technology can intersect in practical applications.
